# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The task of this assignment from V. Isualize was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using the same data utilizing both Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv
- Data Source: ride_data.csv

## Summary
The analysis of the data shows that a majority of the rides that make the most profit would be from the Urban core and that most riders are in the Urban or city. However, the most profit per driver is made in the Rural area but that can be contributed to the distance that is traveled between pickups and drops offs. The city offers the most fares due to the number of riders and drivers.



## Challenge Overview
The challenge included gathering the DataFrame and summarizing key pieces of the data. As well as dive into the data to analyze subsets and then compare and contrast the data.


## Challenge Summary
After downloading the student starter code and using jupyter notebook I was able to code the specific deliverables.
